#### Deliverables for 12/22
- [x] Framework and Technologies:
	- React
	- React router 4
	- Firebase
	- APIs- Google maps(directions), Wikipedia(description for peaks and images), Wunderground(weather), maybe Mapbox(overview map)


- [x] Research Spike: Links to at least 5 resources where you have done research on similar projects, potential data sources, UI inspiration
	- [14ers.com](https://www.14ers.com/) - only other app/website I've found for just 14ers, good data, bad UI/UX, ability to filter but not search, hard to find descriptions
	- [All Trails](http://www.alltrails.com/explore?q=denver%20colorado) - ability to search by area and see an overview map of trails in that area; gives difficulty of trail, ability to favorite, description, photos, directions, reviews, elevation gain and distance, route info, and option to record hike route
	- [The Outbound Collective](https://www.theoutbound.com/) - find local adventures, renders by cards with photo and name, can favorite; provides description, distance, elevation gain, trail type, skill level, photos, reviews, and directions
	- [Day Hikes Near Denver](http://dayhikesneardenver.com/) - ability to find hikes by a number of different attributes (difficulty, map, drive time, distance, features); site displays hikes with cards that have photos and a short description that can be clicked for more info; filtering options are nice, but having so many complicates it; seeing a list of all of the hikes instead of having to click through the 15 pages would be better
	- [Wikipedia list of 14ers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Colorado_fourteeners) - includes all of Colorado's 14ers, their rank based on elevation, name of each Mountain peak, mountain range, elevation, and location(latitude and longitude); this information will be useful for building my own dataset ('lib/data.js')
- [x] Set up [Waffle](https://waffle.io/ccgamble/14ers) and have 10-15 user stories
- [x] Wireframes of all pages + navigational flow
- [x] <s>Fake Data</s> Created a dataset using real 14er data ('/lib/data.js').

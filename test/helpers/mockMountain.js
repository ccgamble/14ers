After leaving the parking area, the trail crosses a bridge to the south side of the creek and proceeds westward 1.5 miles, to a trail junction just after the trail returns to the north side of the creek on a second bridge. Take the right-hand trail, marked Horn Fork Basin, northwest, then north 2.5 miles to timberline. Camp in this area.\nFrom camp, follow the North Cottonwood Trail 1.25 miles to the basin below Mount Harvard. The trail veers right, up and across and talus field near Bear Lake. Continue north up the steep grass and rock ridge. Proceed under the crest of the south shoulder of the summit block, and scramble up large boulders to the summit. A nontechnical route to Columbia from Harvard is to descend southeast into the Frenchman Creek drainage and then back up Columbia's north slope about a half mile from the summit. Return the way you came. The western scree slopes of Columbia have been severely impacted and eroded by climbers (there is no constructed trail). "} ]
